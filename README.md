As a developer
I want to show you a demo of SpecFlow that I made for a client
So that you think I'm awesome
```

## Wreckastow
This is the web shop for an imaginary record store. 
It's implemented using [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) because 
I needed something that was easy to self host and I've been wanting to learn Nancy for some time.

## Wreckastow.Specs
This project contains the executable specifications for WreckaStow. 
I.e feature files written in the Gherkin language and step definitions.
